June 6 1999 :

- EllipsisSym to represent the "..." in function declarations.
- Declaring new style function parameters (except typecast ones)
- (void) function header
- Implemented enum-s (as far as possible without expressions)

- Added bC9X compile option
- Added keyword _Bool and made it depend on the bC9X option
- Added some support for the __restrict qualifier. That is: is parsed
  and preserved, but no checks are made.
