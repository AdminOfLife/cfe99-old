* We need to compare if a value X is (X >= A) && (X <= B). If
A and B are within reasonable limits (we shal see what limits...),

  unsigned t;
  if ((t = X - A) <= (B - A))
    ok

We use the fact that if X < A, the negative value (X - A) used as
unsigned will be bigger than (B - A).
This should be very usefull for switch statements with jump tables,
when we are checking if the switch value is withing the table limits.
